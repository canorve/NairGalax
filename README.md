# Tensorflow Galaxy Image Classifier

This is a Galaxy image classificator based on the TensorFlow Image Classifier 
of [Siraj](https://github.com/llSourcell/tensorflow_image_classifier). Classificator
has been trained using Nair & Graham (ApJSS 186, 427 2010) galaxies with images from [SDSS](https://www.sdss.org/). 


## Requirements

* Please follow instructions at TensorFlow Image Classifier [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/tensorflow_image_classifier)

## Guess process

Just type for a single guess
```
 ./guess.sh [any_path]/my_own_classifier /yourfile.jpg
```

To guess an entire directory
```
./guessDir.sh [any_path]/classifier [any_path]/srcDir [any_path]/destDir
```

## Note

* This is just a learning experiment. Please do not take seriously. 
* for "any_path" use the full path of the file.
